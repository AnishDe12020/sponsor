### Running the template

- Clone the repository you have been redirected to by

```
git clone url
```

- Installing the node modules

```
yarn install # yarn
npm install # npm
```

- Starting the server

```
npm run dev # yarn
yarn dev # npm
```

## Setting up stripe

Create a new file `.env.local` and copy the content of `.env.sample`. Go to [stripe](https://stripe.com/), sign up for an account then create a project. Click on developers in the header and get the api keys.

Copy the api keys and paste them in `.env.local` respectively. Restart your server-

```
npm run dev # yarn
yarn dev # npm
```

The app now works! Since this is in test mode, you can just use 4242 as the card.

## Making changes

To add your details go to the data.json file in the public folder and replace my data with yours.

To customize the colors go to `tailwind.config.js` and replace the existing colors with your brand colors.

```
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push
```
